AK Sommerville: a k sommerville at g mail dot com

Should be self-explanatory? But just in case...
 - A or B to proceed from intro splash. It can take a second or two here to generate the puzzle.
 - D-pad to move the cursor.
 - A to edit a cell (focus moves to the "palette" on the lower right)
 - B to cancel edit, or A to accept.
 - Game ends when the last cell is correctly filled in.
 
We don't save a high score, maybe will do that in the future.

The puzzles seem too easy... I might need to revisit the generator algorithm some time.
